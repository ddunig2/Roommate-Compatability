# Roommate-Compatability
First-Year Project to see if roommates are a good fit

Measure compatibility between potential roommates.
FullRoster.txt contains the list of students. For each student, there contains their name, gender and birthday. 
Also includes preference for quiet time, music, reading and chatting. 
Using this information, we then determine the compatibility between two people for rooming together, 
according to a formula developed by the Office of Housing and Residence Life.
